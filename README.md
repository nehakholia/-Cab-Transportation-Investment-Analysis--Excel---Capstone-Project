1. Profitability: Determine which company, Black Cab or Red Cab, generates the highest profit.
Performance Over Time: Assess which company consistently performs well across different time periods.
2. Top Customers: Identify the top 10 customers based on income and determine the most profitable customer.
3. Demographics Analysis:

- Identify age groups with lower travel frequency and those with higher cab usage.
4. Profitability Dashboard: Create a dynamic dashboard that highlights profitability across different demographics, including gender, age group, and income level.
Deliverables
